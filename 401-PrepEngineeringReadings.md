- **2. Understand the problem, lnow exactly what's being asked**
- You know you understand when you can explain it
- Write it down/doodle/tell someone else about it
- **3. Plan before problem solve**
- Plan your solution
- Given X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?
- Comments
- **4. Stuck?**
- Take a deep breathe
- Debug, go step by step through your solution to find where you wen wrong (Debugging)
- Reassess, take a step back, look at the problem from another perspective
- Start new, delete the old and have fresh eyes
- Research sub solutions to learn or waste your time
- **5. Practice, practice, practice**

## Solving Problems

- Read the problem completely twice
- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data
- Optimize the manual steps
- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code
- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code
- Optimize the real code
- ***As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3***
