# Socket.io

## [Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

1. What is a Web Socket?
A computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over asingle TCP connection

2. Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the
connection is established.
A standardized way for the server to send content to the client without being first requested by the client, and allowing messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open. In this way, a two-way ongoing conversation can take place between the client and the server.

3. Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a request from that client.

## [Socket.io Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/)

1. What does the event handler io.on() do?
Enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It works on every
platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed.

2. Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected.
For Socket.IO it will log "A user connected", every time a user goes to this page.

```
var app = require('express')();
var http = require('http').Server(app);
var io = require('socket.io')(http);
 
app.get('/', function(req, res){ res.sendFile('E:/test/index.html');
});
 
//Whenever someone connects this gets executed
io.on('connection', function(socket){
   console.log('A user connected');
   
   //Whenever someone disconnects this piece of code executed
socket.on('disconnect', function () {
    console.log('A user disconnected');
   });
});
http.listen(3000, function(){
   console.log('listening on *:3000');
});
```

3. What does socket.emit() do?
Socket.IO provides us the ability to create custom events. You can create and fire custom
events using the socket.emit function. Following code emits an event called testerEvent.

## [Socket.io vs Web Sockets](https://www.educba.com/websocket-vs-socket-io/)

1. What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth
and Auth0).
WebSocket:

1. It is the protocol which is established over the TCP connection
2. provides full duplex communication on TCP connections
3. proxy and load balancer are not supported
4. Doesn’t support broad casting
5. Doesn’t have fallback option

Socket.IO:

1. It is the library to work with WebSocket
2. Provides event-based communication between browser and server
3. Connection can be established in the presence of proxies and load balancers.
4. Supports broadcasting
5. Supports fallback option

2. When would you use Socket.IO?
When a connection can be established in the presence of proxies and load balancers.

3. When would you use WebSockets?
When needing full-duplex communication on TCP connections.

## [OSI Model Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv4y_uOneC0)

1. What are a couple of key takeaways from this video?
OSI- Open system Interconnection Mode defines and is used to understand – How data is
transferred from one computer to another in a computer network even if they have different
operating systems with a set of protocols/layers such as Application, Presentation, Session,
Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical for the internet.

## [TCP Handshakes Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtP5ZB3wSk)

1. Translate the gist of this video to a non-technical friend
Establish the connection from the client to the server, establish connection from the server to
the client, which forms a 2 way connection to establish messages like a customer who
purchases an online order and picks it up at the store with the request and connection.
