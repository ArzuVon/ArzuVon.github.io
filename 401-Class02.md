# Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

## An introduction to NodeJS and Express

1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
    - Middleware is something that is going to run between the time the server gets the request and the time the server sends the request out to the client. Middleware runs before and after. It also parses through JSON requests so it is similar to explaining a new yorker getting gas from the gas station and the gas station worker ask what type of gas you want, you answer, and then the gas worker stands by and fills up your gas tank based on what you requested.

2. Express the most popular __ __ ____.
    - Node web framework
3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
    - Unopinionated frameworks have far fewer restrictions than opinionated on the best way to glue components together to achieve a goal, or even what components should be used.
4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
    - A module is a function or group of similar functions. They are grouped together within a file and contain the code to execute a specific task when called into a larger application. In JavaScript, we use the import and export keywords to share and receive functionalities respectively across different modules.
    - **Example:**
        - a program for creating an account,
        - a program to validate the information,
        - another program to process payments
        - another program to calculate the user ratings [FreeCodeCamp, 2022](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-modules-explained-with-examples/#:~:text=A%20module%20in%20JavaScript%20is,object%20accessible%20to%20other%20modules)

## What is NPM?

>npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
    - npm: '8.12.1'
2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?
    - npm install jshint or npm i jshint

## What is TDD?

>coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring).

1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
    - tests are important because we want to write and correct failed test before writing new code. Once test are passed new code can be written. This is similar to accomplishing goals one at a time, learning lessons and growing from them to move on to the next goal.
2. What are three expected benefits of testing
    - Significant reductions in defect rates, at the cost of a moderate increase in initial development effort
    - Report that these overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects’ final phases
    - TDD leads to improved design qualities in the code, and more generally a higher degree of “internal” or technical quality, for instance improving the metrics of cohesion and coupling

3. Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.
    **Individual pitfalls**
    - writing tests that are too large or coarse-grained
    - forgetting to run tests frequently
    **Team pitfalls**
    - poor maintenance of the test suite – most commonly leading to a test suite with a prohibitively long running time
    - abandoned test suite (i.e. seldom or never run) – sometimes as a result of poor maintenance, sometimes as a result of team turnover

## CI/CD

1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
    - Merges everyones changes/code and integrates it to the current version of the project
    - Catches bugs
    - Reduces merge conflicts

2. What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
    - Continuos delivery is the practice of developing software where you could release it at anytime, and continuous deployment is an extension of continuous delivery that lets you deploy newly developed features immideiately

3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background
    - Github acts as a person creating a groupchat in groupMe. Everyone can text the groupchat and recieve the same messages but the person who created the group me can remove someone to prevent errors/offensive language at anytime to keep the smooth communication. The person who created the groupMe also acts as github because they can add, accept, or deny user request to join the groupchat.
