# Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

## An introduction to NodeJS and Express

1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
    _middleware is something that is going to run between the time the server gets the request and the time the server sends the request out to the client. Middleware runs before and after. It also parses through JSON requests so it is similar to explaining a new yorker getting gas from the gas station and the gas station worker ask what type of gas you want, you answer, and then the gas worker stands by and fills up your gas tank based on what you requested.

4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
    _A module is a function or group of similar functions. They are grouped together within a file and contain the code to execute a specific task when called into a larger application. In JavaScript, we use the import and export keywords to share and receive functionalities respectively across different modules.
    - **Example:**
        _a program for creating an account,
        _a program to validate the information,
        _another program to process payments
        _another program to calculate the user ratings [FreeCodeCamp, 2022](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-modules-explained-with-examples/#:~:text=A%20module%20in%20JavaScript%20is,object%20accessible%20to%20other%20modules)
