# Implementation: Stacks and Queues

## [Stacks and Queues](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html)


>Using an analogy, for LIFO, a stack would refer to stack of books since you can remove only the top book, also you can add a new book on the top. A stack can also be viewed as a stack of cafeteria trays removing the top and adding a tray to the top.

>Using queue analogies for FIFO would be a car wash since you get there first and leave the other end first, as well as a ticket line at the motor vehicle
