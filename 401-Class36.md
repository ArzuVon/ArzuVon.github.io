# Application State with Redux

## [Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)

- What is the first principle of Redux? Deciding if your app is simple or complex with a lot of UI changes. Every change is manages by the single immutable state tree

  - note: The state tree is read only. You cannot change the state you need to use a dispatch action to change the state.

- what is a store and what do we use our reducers for within that store?

  - Store binds together three principles of redux and holds the current state object, then dispatch actions, and specify reducer to tell how the state is updated with actions.

- Name three Redux store methods given to us by createStore and describe their use.

  - getState() retrieves current state of redux, initial state
  - dispatch() dispatch actions to change state of an application
  - subscribe() register a callback that the redux tool will call to update the UI to the current state

- Explain to a non-technical recruiter what combineReducers() does and why it is useful.
  - `combineReducers` is useful because it updates multiple changes on one specific action/change and returns a new reducer function
