# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## [AWS API Gateway Overview](https://www.serverless.com/amazon-api-gateway)

- What is Amazon API Gateway?

  - Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

- Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?
  - Many Serverless applications use Amazon API Gateway, which conveniently replaces the API servers with a managed serverless solution.

- How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?
  - Many AWS services support integration with Amazon API Gateway, including:
    - AWS Lambda: run Lambda functions to generate HTTP API responses.
    - AWS SNS: publish SNS notifications when an HTTP API endpoint is accessed.
    - Amazon Cognito: provide authentication and authorization for your HTTP APIs.

- API Gateway supports direct integrations that can be configured in the API Gateway user interface (or via the API Gatewayâ€™s own API) for the following actions:

  - Invoking an AWS Lambda function.
  - Invoking another HTTP endpoint, with or without VPC Link.
  - Making an HTTP call against the API of any AWS service that provides an HTTP API.
  - Returning a mock response generated within API Gateway without calling out to other services.

- What are the some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway?
  - Efficient API development, Performance at any scale, RESTful API options, Flexible security controls, Easy monitoring, Cost savings at scale

- What two API types might you choose from?
  - RESTful APIs
    - optimized for serverless workloads and HTTP backends using HTTP APIs. HTTP APIs are the best choice for building APIs that only require API proxy functionality.

  - WEBSOCKET APIs
    - Build real-time two-way communication applications, such as chat apps and streaming dashboard

## [AWS DynamoDB Guide](https://www.dynamodbguide.com/what-is-dynamo-db/)

- What is DynamoDB?

  - a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers:
    - reliable performance even as it scales;
    - a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
    - a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.

- Under what circumstances would you recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB?
  - Applications with large amounts of data and strict latency requirements, Serverless applications using AWS Lambda, and Data sets with simple, known access patterns

## [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

1. Explain to a non-technical friend how DynamoDB works.

> Since Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database designed to run high-performance applications at any scale that offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-Region replication, in-memory caching, and data import and export tools...

- I would tell my non-techniacal friend that DynamoDB works, like, a system of ids, names, and positions stored in a database like bookkeeping since its collections of data for records.

## [Dynamoose](https://dynamoosejs.com/getting_started/Introduction)

- What is Dynamoose?
  - Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Dynamoose is heavily inspired by Mongoose

- What are some key features of Dynamoose?
  - Type safety
  - High level API
  - Easy to use syntax
  - DynamoDB Single Table Design Support
  - Ability to transform data before saving or retrieving items
  - Strict data modeling (validation, required attributes, and more)
  - Support for DynamoDB Transactions
  - Powerful Conditional/Filtering Support
  - Callback & Promise support
  - AWS Multi-region support
