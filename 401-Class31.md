# REACT Context API

## [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

- What can React Context provide your app?

  - Context provides a way to share values like locale preference or UI theme between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree

- Why might we use Context?

  - Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language

- Why should we use it sparingly?

  - Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult


## [Awesome React Context links](https://github.com/diegohaz/awesome-react-context)

- Consume content from (at least) two of the Awesome React Context links. Share your take-away from each:

  - Takeaway 1: To get started with the context API all you have to do is declare a context variable, like, Const MyContext = React.createContext(“Hello”) creating a context with the default value of hello.   When passing context through LocaleSelect the context state can update and change between options depending on what the user selects.

  - Takeaway 2: Context API. Context makes it easy to pass props down to any child in your tree, even if they are not a direct child.
