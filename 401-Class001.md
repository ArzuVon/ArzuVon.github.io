# **Functional Programming**

> ## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia
  `pure function`

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

- returns the same result if given the same arguments

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

- easy to test

4. What is immutability?

- Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

5. What is Referential transparency?

- if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

> ## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

What is a module?

- another javascript file

What does the word ‘require’ do?

- it allows us to globally grab the module and pass it to another module

How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

```js
require("./(module name)");
```

What do we have to do to make a module available?

```
module.exports = (module function);
```

> ## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

1. What is a ‘call’?

- it invokes a function and the call stack is synchonous

2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

- 1

3. What does LIFO mean?

- Last in, first out

4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

```js
function firstFunction() {
  throw new Error("Stack Trace Error");
}

function secondFunction() {
  firstFunction();
}

function thirdFunction() {
  secondFunction();
}

thirdFunction();
```

( example taken from: [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4))

5. What causes a Stack Overflow?

- when a function calls itself

> ## JavaScript error messages

What is a ‘refrence error’?

- an error kind of like when you haven't yet declared a veriable, an error code diplays this messege.

What is a ‘syntax error’?

- Basically when something isn't written correctly as a function

What is a ‘range error’?

- an array cannot have a negative length. errors out

What is a ‘type error’?

- when using Numbers instead of strings and returns undifined

What is a breakpoint?

- point in which your code stops

What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

- debuf your code

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

- Complex query intensive enviroment

2. Give a real world example.

- When pulling data from a server

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

- hierarchical data storage

4. Give a real world example.

- Hbase

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

- NoSql

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

- SQL

> ## sql vs nosql

What does SQL stand for?

- Structure Query Language

What is a relational database?

- a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them.

What type of structure does a relational database work with?

- Schema

What is a ‘schema’?

- basically a template for a database with feilds

What is a NoSQL database?

- databse capable of storing lots and lots of data

How does it work?

- no schema and multiple document storage. Very flexable and you can add more data

What is inside of a Mongo database?

- You have collections and documents

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

- MongoDB since you cab add more data and no relational database

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

- duplicate data

# **CRUD**

> ## Status Codes Based On REST Methods

1. In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

- 100’s = the header part recieved and the server will try to comply with request.
- 200’s = request accepted
- 300’s = source no lonhger available
- 400’s = client error. invalid request
- 500’s = server errors

2. What is a status code 202?

- request valid and accepted

3. What is a status code 308?

- tells the client tu use another URL

4. What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?

- 204

5. What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?

- 410

6. What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?

- 403

> ## Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB

1. Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?

- we want to create a veriable that links it to the .env file so the client doesnt have access to it.

2. What is middleware?

- lets us route information

3. What does `app.use(express.json())` do?

- lets the server accept JSON

4. What does the `/:id` mean in a route?

- its a parameter that is accessable by usung req.params.id

5. What is the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`?

- patch only updates with what the client gives us. Put will update all the information at once

6. How do you make a default value in a schema?

```js

nameDate: {
  type: Date,
  required: true
  default: Date.now
}
```

7. What does a `500` error status code mean?

- server error

8. What is the difference between a status `200` and a status `201`?

- 200 = everything was successful, 201 = successfully created an object

# **More CRUD**

> ## CRUD Basics

1. Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

- GET

2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

- Delete

> ## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API

1. What’s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

- REST allows the user to CRUD. It's dependant on it.

2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

- Using HTTP
- Getting information from an API
- Creating an API resource
- Updating the API resource
- and deleting the resource

# **Authentication**

> ## What is OAuth

1. What is OAuth?

- its a freamework created for servers to safely allow authentication access to their assets without actually disclosing login info.

2. Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.

- its basically another website that gives permission to the site a user is logging into and grantinf them permission

3. How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?

- A second website connects on the behalf of the user
- a one-time token is generated for the parties involved
- first sent to the user software
- if not authorized the client may be asked to authorize.
- the usuer is asked to approve and then gives approval
- the user is given an approved acess token
- user gives token to the first website
- the first website gives the approved token to the second website on users behalf
- user sees successfully completed transaction

4. What is OpenID?

- as mentioned in a StackOverflow comment
  - Oauth is for maschines accessing maschines
  - OpenId is for humans loggin into maschines

> ## Authorization and Authentication flows

- What is the difference between authorization and authentication?

- authorization grants access to a user from one computer to another and authintication grants access based on the user.

- What is Authorization Code Flow?

- the process in which authorization takes place

- What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?

- basically its a code verifier. Another process to authenticate

- What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?

- user to accesses app, authO is accessed by app, authO asks user to login and credantia;s, user gives it back and authO gives it to ID token to app

- What is Client Credentials Flow?

- Auth0 certifies after user requests and then the user provides token to API

- What is Device Authorization Flow?

- occurs on the device requesting authorization and the other occurs in a browser.

- What is Resource Owner Password Flow?

- requests that users provide credentials (username and password), typically using an interactive form.
