# Context API - Behaviors

## [Hooks and Context example](https://medium.com/swlh/snackbars-in-react-an-exercise-in-hooks-and-context-299b43fd2a2b)

- With regard to the React Context API, what does a “provider” do?
  - The provider acts as a delivery service. When a consumer asks for something, it finds it in the context and delivers it to where it's needed.

- With regard to the React Context API, how would we implement a “consumer” role?
  - A consumer is where the stored information ends up. It can request data via the provider and manipulate the central store if the provider allows it.

- Specifically with Context, how are we “wrapping” components to achieve our goals?
  - It consumes the new context

- Consume content from (at least) two more of the Awesome React Context links. After some familiarity with React Context, once again share your takeaways from each:

  - Takeaway 1: Consuming a new object being created every single time this provider is rendered from the context, will potentially also be getting re-rendered which is not great.
  - Takeaway 2: Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes. The Provider component accepts a value prop to be passed to consuming components that are descendants of this Provider.
