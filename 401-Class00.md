# **Introduction to React and Components**

> ## Reading: "Component-Based Architecture"

1. What is a component ?

- A component is considered a well-defined functionallity that is portable, replaceable, reusable, and modular. It interacts with other components and in it are functions that allow it to perform certain tasks that are specific or global.

2. What are the characteristics of a component ?

- They are as follows:

```html
- Reusability - Replaceable - Not context specific - Extensible - Encapsulated -
independent
```

3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture ?

- There are many advantages for using components. Some are as follows:

  - **Ease of Deployment** - its easy to replace if a newer version becomes available.

  - **Reduced cost** - You're able to use 3rd party components reducing your overall cost of development and maintanance

  - **Reusable** - You can access and use them across the development of the system

  - **Reliability** - each component is realiable, strengthening the overall reliability of the system as a whole

> ## Reading: "What is Props and How to Use it in React"

1. What is “props” short for ?

- Props are basically connectors. Connectors of components in React. They send datat between components and props is the way to pass that data.

2. How are props used in React ?

- Props are used to get dynamic outputs on different components. An example is if a Parent component has multiple child components that need to have different data, props can help facilitate that.

3. What is the flow of props ?

- **unidirectional flow** - from parent to child

# **State and Props**

> ## Reading: "React lifecycle"

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

- Answer: **_Render_**

2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

- Answer: **_Mounting_**

3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: `componentDidMount`, `render`, `constructor`, `componentWillUnmount`, `React Updates`

Answer: 1. **_`React Updates`, 2. `constructor`, 3. `render`, 4. `componentDidMount`, 5.`componentWillUnmount`_**

4. What does componentDidMount do?

Answer: **_It invokes a component right after React compnent has been mounted._**

> ## Videp: "React State Vs Props"

1. What types of things can you pass in the props?

- THings you don't want to hard code. Such as text that simply displays, like a title.

2. What is the big difference between props and state?

- Props you pass into the components. State is inside your component.

3. When do we re-render our application?

- After the information passes through the component.

4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

- Things that need updating. Like information on a list. Grocery list checkbox.

# **State and Props**

> ## React Docs - lists and keys

1. What does .map() return?

```js
map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.

map() calls a function once for each element in an array.

map() does not execute the function for empty elements.

map() does not change the original array.
```

2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

- You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.

3. Each list item needs a unique \_\_\_\_.

- key

4. What is the purpose of a key?

- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

> ## The Spread Operator

1. What is the spread operator?

- The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.

2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

```html
1. Copying an array 2. Concatenating or combining arrays 3. Using Math functions
4. Using an array as arguments
```

3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

```js
const myArray = [`1`, `2`, `3`];
const yourArray = [`4`, `5`, `6`];
const ourArray = [...myArray, ...yourArray];
console.log(...ourArray); // 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

```js
const fewNum = ["1", "2", "3"];
const fewMoreNum = ["4", "5", ...fewNum];
console.log(fewMoreNum); //  Array(5) [ "4", "5", "1", "2", "3" ]
```

5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

```js
const objectOne = { firstName: "Bob" };
const objectTwo = { lastName: "Smith" };
const objectThree = { ...objectOne, ...objectTwo, saysHey: "Hey!" };
console.log(objectThree); // Object { hello: "bob", world: "Smith", laugh: "Hey!" }
const objectFour = {
  ...objectOne,
  ...objectTwo,
  saysHey: () => {
    console.log("Hey!".repeat(5));
  },
};
objectFour.saysHey(); // Hey!Hey!Hey!Hey!Hey!
```

> ## How to pass functions between components

1. In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

- Creates the function where ever the state is that he's going to change.

2. In your own words, what does the increment function do?

- Increment is a function that allows objects to pass through and increment and update the count.

3. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

- using this.props

4. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

- Same way using this.props I believe

# **React and Forms**

> ## React Docs - Forms

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

- An input form element whose value is controlled by React

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

- As soon as they type. It runs on every keystroke to update React state.

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- we target the value of whats being submitted.

> ## THe Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?

- when using it instead of an (**_if_**) Statement.

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

```javascript
if (x === y) {
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
```

```javascript
x === y ? "true" : "false";
```

# **Putting it all together**

> ## Thinking in React

1. What is the single `responsibility principle` and how does it apply to components?

- based on the ifo provided by reactjs.org "a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents." So if a component starts growing it'll need different components to provide it information needed for the growth.

2. What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

- THis means to build each component and have it render on the page even if it wont work fuctionally. Example: create a search bar and render it even though it may not actually work.

3. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?

- basically you need fto have it work at a minimal level first after that.

4. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

- are the props being passed or are they being managed within the component. is there a constructor in the constructor? are props being passed through 'super'?

5. How can you identify where state needs to live?

- depending what components need the information that state is rendering, you would put it at the highest level i order for it to cascade to the compnents that need that information or data.

> ## Higher-Order Functions

1. What is a “higher-order function”?

- [Here](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK) it states that **_"Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions."_**

2. Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

- looks like we set m > n in the original function. GreaterThan10 is equal to the original function passing 10 as a parameter. We then call greaterThank10 passing 11 which would be calling is greaterThan10(11) > greatherThan(10). this is results into is 11 > 10 = true.

3. Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.

- Well in order to get the end result of what you'd like to map() it would need to run its funtional process to give you that information to do what you need with. Thos can be considered a higher-order funtion.

> ## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

```HTML
1. Greater efficiency  2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students 4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness 6. Work environment readiness
```

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

- Engaged collaboration

3. How does pair programming work?

- There is someone typing and exicuting code (Driver) and theres the other person advising or telling the driver what to type (The Navigator)

> ## How I explained REST to my brother

- Who is Roy Fielding?

  - THe dude that built the first servers to carry documentaions across the web.

Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
