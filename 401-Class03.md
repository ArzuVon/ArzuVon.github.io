## Review: ES6 Classes

1. Classes are a template for creating ____.

- Objects

2. Can a class declaration be hoisted?

- Classes defined using a class declaration are hoisted
- Meaning that JavaScript has a reference to the class. However the class is not initialized by default, so any code that uses it before the line in which it is initialized is executed will throw a ReferenceError.
[Resource](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting>)
- A class decoration can be hoisted but must be defined before they can be constructed.

3. How would you describe a constructor and contextual “this” to a non-technical friend?

-I would tell my non-technical friend to think of the NBA and each NBA team with players for a brief example of constructors and the this keyword would point to each specific/individual team like Golden state and players Steph Curry...etc

### Example for myself

```
// constructor function
function Person () {
    this.name = 'John',
    this.age = 23
}

// create an object
const person = new Person();
```

```
// constructor function
function Person () {
    this.name = 'John',
}

// create object
const person1 = new Person();

// access properties
console.log(person1.name);  // John
```

## Using Express Routing

1. Within Express, what does routing refer to?

- Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing, see Basic routing in link below.
[Resource](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)

2. What is the difference between a route path and a route method?

- A route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the express class.
- Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.

3. When is it appropriate to add next as a parameter to a route handler and what must you do if next has been passed to your middleware as a parameter?

- Add next as a parameter to a route handler when you want to pass control to the next handler
- We cannot directly pass data to the next middleware, but we can send data through the request object
- Next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

## Express Routing

1. What is an Express Router?

- Router is like a mini-Express application. It doesn’t bring in views or settings but provides us with the routing APIs like .use, .get, .param, and route

2. By what mean do we initialize express.Router() in an express server?

- Get an instance of route, apply routes to it, and then tell our application to use those routes

3. What do we use route middleware for?

- Route middleware in Express is a way to do something before a request is processed. This could be things like checking if a user is authenticated, logging data for analytics, or anything else we’d like to do before we actually spit out information to our user
