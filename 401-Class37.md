# Redux - Combined Reducers

[Multiple Reducers Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBER4Or86hE)

1. Why create multiple reducers?

   - Create multiple reducers for multiple pieces of information so they can each have their own files to better maintain. One gigantic reducer will be a mess to maintain.

2. How would you combine multiple reducers?

   - By using the combine reducers import `combineReducers` from redux.

3. How will you manage state as an immutable object? why?

- 1 of the 4 ways should work:
  - Approach #1: Object.assign, which creates a copy of an object that is stored in state. Shallow clone only.
  - Approach #2: Object Spread, is currently a stage 3 feature, and can be transpiled by Babel. Shallow clone only.
    - No polyfill required, since Babel can transpile
    - More concise
  - Approach #3: Immutability Helper is a handy library for mutating a copy of data without changing the source.
  - Approach #4: Immutable.js provides immutable data structures.

## [Redux Docs: Using Combined Reducers](https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/using-combinereducers/)

1. combineReducers is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing **\_\_\_\_** .

   - Redux reducers

2. Explain how combineReducers assembles the new state tree.

   - In order to assemble the new state tree, `combineReducers` will call each slice reducer with its current slice of state and the current action, giving the slice reducer a chance to respond and update its slice of state if needed. Using `combineReducers` does "call all reducers", or at least all of the slice reducers it is wrapping.

3. How would you define initial state in an app using combineReducers?

   - First, the `createStore` function can take `preloadedState` as its second argument which is intended for initializing the store with state that was previously persisted elsewhere, such as the browser's localStorage. The other way is for the root reducer to return the initial state value when the state argument is undefined.

[Redux Docs: Combined Reducer Syntax](https://redux.js.org/api/combinereducers/)

1. Why will you want to split your reducing functions as your app becomes more complex?

   - As your app grows more complex, you'll want to split your reducing function into separate functions, each managing independent parts of the state.

2. The **\_** helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to \_\_\_\_.

   - `combineReducers`, `createStore`

3. What is a popular convention when naming reducers?

   - A popular convention is to name reducers after the state slices they manage, so you can use ES6 property shorthand notation: `combineReducers({ counter, todos })` which is equivalent to writing `combineReducers({ counter: counter, todos: todos })`.
