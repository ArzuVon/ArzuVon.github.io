# Authentication Readings

## Securing Passwords

1. Explain to a non-technical friend how you would safely hash and store a password.
    - In almost all circumstances, passwords should be hashed, not encrypted. To safely hash and store a password, I would  use a hash function such as Bcrypt or SHA-3.

2. What is Bcrypt?
    - Bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David MaziÃ¨res, based on the Blowfish cipher and presented at USENIX in 1999
    - An adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force search attacks even with increasing computation power

3. Why might you use something like Bcrypt?
    - You might use Bcrypt because overtime, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower allowing bcrypt to scale with computing power

## Basic Auth

1. What is Basic Authentication?
    - A method for an HTTP user agent (web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request.

2. What properties are necessary in the header of a Basic Auth request?
    - The word Basic, followed by a space and a base64-encoded(non-encrypted) string username: password. are necessary in the header.

3. How are username:password in Basic Auth encoded?
    - Encoded in Base64

## OWASP auth cheatsheet

1. Define the authentication process to a non-technical recruiter.
    - Verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be, like when you click forget password on your email or user account for a website, it verifys if you are you through email, phone text code, etc.

2. How should your error messaging respond (both HTTP and HTML)? Why?
    - Incorrectly implemented error messages, in the case of authentication functionality, can be used for the purposes of user ID and password enumeration. An application should respond (both HTTP and HTML) in a generic manner to be readable.

security in mind from inception have fewer vulnerabilities throughout their lifecycle.
