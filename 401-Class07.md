# JWT

## [Intro to JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/)

1. What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?

- An open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

2. When should we use JSON Web Tokens? Authorization and information exchange scenario's.

3. Claims are expected in which structural component of a JWT? Structural component of JWT, Header, Payload, and signature.

- Claims are expected in payload. There are three types of claims, registered, public, and private.

## [Are JWTs Secure?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27301557/if-you-can-decode-jwt-how-are-they-secure)

1. If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure? The secret hash would not be correct when you change the payload

2. If sending a JWT, what must sender and receiver both know? Hint, itâ€™s appended in the signature. They need to know if the signatures match by calculate Hash(payload + secret).

3. Explain how concatenated content and secret can be sent and received securely to a non-technical recruiter.

- Concatenated content and secret can be sent and recieved if the recipient knows the secret. If the recippient knows the secret, they can calculate the signature of any message and check if its correct. If the recipient does not know the secret, they cannot sign the message.
