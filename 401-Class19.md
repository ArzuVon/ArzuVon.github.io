# AWS: Events

## [AWS SQS vs SNS](https://medium.com/awesome-cloud/aws-difference-between-sqs-and-sns-61a397bf76c5)

### SNS: Simple notification Service

### SQS: Simple Queue Service

What is the difference betweeen SQS and SNS?

- SNS is a distributed publish-subscribe service, while SQS is a distributed queueing serivice.

- SQS is mainly used to decouple applications, while SNS distributes several copies of a message to several subscribers.

- What are some use cases for both SNS and SQS?

  - Use SNS if you would like to deal with multiple subscribers to that message and would like to be able to publish/consume batches of messages, or if you would like the same message to be processed in multiple ways.
  - Use SQS if you need a simple queue with no additional requirements and want to allow parallel asynchronous processing.

Describe how to use SQS and SNS in a “fanout” pattern.

- When sending a single event to multipule endpoints, that is an SNS process. One of the endpoints can be an SQS where the event is stored and garunteed to be read by a service.

Explain how “push notifications” work, using SNS.

- SNS can push the notification to many entities that need that information.

- push notifications can be handled by a lambda function. When an event occurs and that payload is sent to Lambda. The function created then auto sends and email/text as a response to the consumer. Example : when you purchase something from Amazon and then you get a thank you email.

How might a large scale, distributed application make use of a Queue system like SQS 

- To ensure things are processed ion the correct order and also use SQS to create a FIFO Queue to ensure that the notifications/messages recieved are handled in the order that they are recieved in.
