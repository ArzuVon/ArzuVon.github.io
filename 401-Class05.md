# Implementation: Linked Lists

>Linked lists are linear data structures because they need a sequence and order to how they are constructed and traversed. They are made of a series of nodes, and like the game hopscotch, getting one way through to complete it. A node only knows about what data it contains, and who its neighbor is. Linked lists are dynamic data structures and don't need a contagious memory, static path, like, arrays. With linked list we mostly traverse to each node by referring to the head and not tail. Referring to the tail is a circular list a different set of analysis.
>Linked list's big O analysis are different from arrays big O. When accessing a random item the big O is O(n), linear, for traversing its O(n), and for construction its O(2) if you know where you want to change. It is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.
