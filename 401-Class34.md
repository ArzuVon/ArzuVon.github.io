# API Integration

## [Review API Server Build](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/api-server/)

- Explain the different between a query string parameter and a path parameter.

  - A query string parameter is simply allowing the route search for any given string provided and can be appended to the end of the URL regardless of whether or not they were specified in code. The path parameter have to be used in the same position that they were specified in the backend and is the endpiont tied to the server that will call the function from a database.

- What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information:

   1. Domain: `http://our-site.com`

   2. `v3`

   3. model name: `stuff`

   4. id: `things`

  - ( <http://our-site.com/API/v3/stuff/things> )

- We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.

  - An API with an interface is a point where two things, like, people, systems, objects, ect. meet and interact or Reacts/changes depending on the users choice of functionality. If you entered personal info is in a google doc, it is dynamic in the way it updates or creates and sends information to the api.

## [Review Auth Server Build](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/auth-server/)

- Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth.

  - When user information, like, username and password get hashed and encrypted with bcrypt, then having that funcntion passed in the enpoint of `post` when the user send given info to our server.

- Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth.

  - When a user logs in, they get routed to OAuth or Auth0. The 3rd party applications used will verify the user and create a token and then we can use it as an "okay good to go".

- Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend.

  - There are roles in like user, admin, manager, and editor in most companies/corporations, and each role according to RBAC will have access to different funtionality within the company or coporation computer system.
