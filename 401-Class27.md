# React Hooks

## [Introducing Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#motivation)

- What was the motivation for introducing Hooks?
  - Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly unconnected problems in React.

- What changes are important regarding implementing Hooks versus Component Classes?
  - Hooks extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused.
  - For component classes, mutually related code that changes together gets split apart, but completely unrelated code (like componentDidMount) ends up combined in a single method. This makes it too easy to introduce bugs and inconsistencies.

- Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing __________.
  - Component hierarchy.

## [hooks api](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)

- Name two rules imposed by React Hook usage.
  - Only Call Hooks at the Top Level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
  - Only Call Hooks from React Functions. Don’t call Hooks

- How would you identify a custom Hook and why might you create one?
  - A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks. Might create if for code reusability that offer the flexibility of sharing logic, and add special, unique functionality to our React applications.

## [the state hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)

- What is a Hook?
  - A hook lets you use state and other React features without writing a class.

- When would I use the useState Hook?
  - To keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and any combination of these like the count of something.

- If you were to add React state to a function component by declaring a state variable:
  - What does calling useState do?
    - declares our state variable
  - What do we pass to useState as an argument?
    - Only the initial state
  - What does useState return?
    - A pair of values, the current state, and the function that updates it.
