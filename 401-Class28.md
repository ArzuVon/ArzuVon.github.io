# [Effects Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)

- What purpose does useEffect serve in a function component compared to its counterpart(s) in class components?

  - useEffect is useful for side effects like data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components. Class components do not use side effects it uses componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.

- When using the useEffect Hook:

  - What does useEffect do? Tells React that your component needs to do something after render.
  - Why is useEffect called inside a component? useEffect inside the component lets us access the count state variable (or any props) right from the effect.
  - Does useEffect run after every render? Yes! By default, it runs both after the first render and after every update.

- Explain the importance of properly implementing effects with Cleanup
  • Setting up a subscription to some external data source it is important to clean up so that we don’t introduce a memory leak.
