# Redux - Additional Topics

## [Redux Toolkit (RTK)](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)

1. What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?

   - "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
   - "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
   - "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

2. What does configureStore() do?

   - Wraps `createStore` to provide simplified configuration options and good defaults. It can automatically combine your slice reducers, adds whatever Redux middleware you supply, includes `redux-thunk` by default, and enables use of the Redux DevTools Extension.

3. How would I use createSlice()?

   - Accepts an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, and automatically generates a slice reducer with corresponding action creators and action types.

## [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html)

1. What is Mobx?

   - A simple, scalable and battle tested state management solution.

2. How does MobX make it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state?

   - It makes state management simple again by addressing the root issue which is maki sure that everything that can be derived from the application state, will be derived. Automatically. MobX treats your applicaton like a spreadsheet.

3. How would we build a reactive user interface?

   - The observer HoC wrapper from the mobx-react-lite package fixes that by basically wrapping the React component in autorun. This keeps the component in sync with the state.

   - The only MobX specific code in there is the observer wrapping. That is enough to make sure that each component individually re-renders when relevant data changes.

## Tutorial

[Tutorial](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/intermediate-tutorial)

- What take-away(s) did this tutorial provide?

  - Redux doesnt depend on any library and mostly used with react. It manages and updates your data on a global scale.You can trace when, where, why, and how your state updates with Redux developer tools and events called actions. You do not always need redux! Even when using React. Most Redux apps use switch statements its the most obvious way but can use if else statements.

  - The Redux toolkit is a fast download

  - Aliasing functions and adding types, like:

  - `export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;`
