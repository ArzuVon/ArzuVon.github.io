Some of them are a little hard to get your head around but they are fairly consistent in their structure so once you get the hang of it it's not too bad

- man <command>Look up the manual page for a particular command.
- man -k <search term> Do a keyword search for all manual pages containing the given search term.
- /<term> Within a manual page, perform a search for 'term'
