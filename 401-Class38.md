# Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## [Async Actions](https://redux.js.org/advanced/asyncactions)

- Why use Redux middleware?

  - Redux store doesn't know anything about async logic and Redux middleware were designed to enable writing logic that has side effects, also know as any change to state or behavior that can be seen outside of returning a value from a function.

- Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.

  - Using asyc logic Redux uses middleware to run request. The middleware gets and receives request from an API then dispatches actions to state changes while using reducer to then display on the UI. Next, when the UI is updated it is sent to an event handler with and action dispatched to repeat a request as needed.

- How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?

  - Redux has an official version of the async function middleware, called the Redux "Thunk" middleware. The thunk middleware allows us to write functions that get dispatch and getState as arguments. Thunk functions can have any async logic we want inside, and that logic can dispatch actions and read the store state as needed.

## [Thunk Middleware](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)

- Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?

  - You would need Redux Thunk middleware to allows writing functions with logic inside that can interact with a Redux store's dispatch and getState methods.

- Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a \_\_\_\_ instead of an action.

  - function

- Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.

  - Any return value from the inner thunk function will be available as the return value of dispatch which is convenient for orchestrating an asynchronous control flow with thunk action creators dispatching each other and returning Promises to wait for each otherâ€™s completion.
