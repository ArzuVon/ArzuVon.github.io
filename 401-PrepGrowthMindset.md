### A Kinder Gentler Philosophy

- You lose something with success, like a sacrafice. I Sacraficed TV
- You have to be the author of your own journey

## Your emotional intelligence

### My own meaning since links did not work

- Discipline will take you farther than motivation
- Do not react to everything sent to you
- Do not react off your emotions, think logical
- Have empathy do not pity
- Sometimes people project and that has nothing to do with you
- Sometimes our emotions and intuition are wrong

## Your biases

- Everyone has their own issues
- Everyone is entitled to their own perspective
- See all perspectives, have an open mind
- Do not judge a book by its cover
- Be kind
