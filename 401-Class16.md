# AWS 

>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) offers the broadest and deepest compute platform, with over 500 instances and choice of the latest processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model to help you best match the needs of your workload.

## AWS EC2

### [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

1. What is an EC2 Instance?
    - A virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.There is over 500 instances.

2. Name 2 use cases for EC2.
    - Develop for Apple platforms
    Build, test, and sign on-demand macOS workloads. Access environments in minutes, dynamically scale capacity as needed, and benefit from AWS’s pay-as-you-go pricing.
    - Run cloud-native and enterprise applications
    Amazon EC2 delivers secure, reliable, high-performance, and cost-effective compute infrastructure to meet demanding business needs.

3. Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of Heroku.
    - Eventhough they are both serverless with cli, ECS with EC2 instances provides even more access and control to the host instance itself. This is great if you want or need to debug the host or container environment.

### [EC2 For Humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZMkgOMYYIg)

1. Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?
    - We can find the elastic compute cloud clicking on EC2 under compute from the All services dropdown and create an instance by clicking Launch Instance.

2. Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.
    - T2 micro and XL differ by power ny relation and storage. XL is for ram and memory compared to cpu with letters like m4 or c infront for diff types like multi purpose or ssd storage etc. T2 micro is for burst credits and you can pull or use credits for spikes.

3. Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.
    - The EC2 compute cycle is a cycle similar to agile in corporate and instead its an instance that transitions through different states from the moment you launch it through to its termination.

### [Elastic Beanstalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrwxAScdyT0)

1. What is Elastic Beanstalk?
    - Deploys, manages, and scales web applications for you while using storage containers in Java, .Net, PHP, NodeJS, Python, Ruby, and Docker on servers like apache http, apache tom cat, passanger, iis ect.

2. Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.
    - Elastic Beanstalk leverages ECS by setting up an "environment" for you that can contain a number of EC2 instances, an optional database, as well as a few other AWS components such as a Elastic Load Balancer, Auto-Scaling Group, Security Group ect.

3. Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.
    - Load Balancing, Provisioning, Application Health monitoring, and auto scaling the app.
