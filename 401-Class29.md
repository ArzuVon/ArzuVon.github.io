# useReducer REACT HOOK

## [useReducer hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)

- Name an alternative to the useState Hook.
  • An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method.

- Why might the useReducer Hook be preferable to the useState Hook?
  • During complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

- What are two ways to set the initial state?
  • In a simplistic way you can pass the initial state as a second argument or lazily you can pass an init function as the third argument. The initial state will be set to init(initialArg).

## [Ultimate Guide to useReducer](https://blog.logrocket.com/react-usereducer-hook-ultimate-guide/)

- In terms of state, what does useReducer expect to receive as a parameter?
  • Like useState, it accepts a reducer function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second.

- What does useReducer return?
  • useReducer returns an array that holds the current state value and a dispatch function to which you can pass an action and later invoke it.

- Explain dispatch to a non-technical recruiter.
  • Dispatch is an action executed to the reducer to perform its job, which, updates the state, like, completing a to do task in real life where the reducer would be toe to do list, and after you complete your action you updating your to do list.
