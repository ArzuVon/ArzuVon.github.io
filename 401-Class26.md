# Component Based UI

## [react hello world](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html)

- What are the building blocks of a React app?
  - Elements and components, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.

- What is the difference between an element and a React component?
  - A React element is an object representation of a DOM node and React is what gets returned from components. A component encapsulates a DOM tree, and the state is mutable.

- What are some advantages of Reacts component-based architecture?
  - Reusability: In Component Driven Development, the development process is in place, components once created can be easily used across as many modules as needed.

## [Introducing JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

- What is JSX and why do we use it?
  - JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that produces React “elements”.

- Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.
  - You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX and JSX only accepts expressions between curly braces.

- Is it safe to embed user input in JSX? Explain.
  - It is safe to embed user input in JSX. React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus, it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application.

## [Rendering Elements](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/rendering-elements.html)

- Explain what a React Component is to a non-technical friend.
  - Web component that are built to solve different problems and they are reusable.

- Describe mutability and React Components, specifically, how is the UI updated?
  - When a property or the state of a component changes, this virtual DOM/UI is updated to reflect those changes.

- If changes are made to the UI, what does React update?
  - Updates state either via props or internal component state.
