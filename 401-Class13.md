Socket.io Chat Example
Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.
The chat example is like a two directional communication channel like a one-way phone call with 2 phones and comms connected by cell towers for service. The chat is a two directional real-time chat system architected with communication channel between a client and a server.
What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app? We define a route that gets called when we hit our website and make the http server listen on port 3000. Then, call io() to see a user is connected.

Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket? Broadcast flag
Rooms
What is a room and how might a room be useful?
A room is an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients
How do you join a room?
socket.join(...), Join by ID and calling join to subscribe the socket to a given channel, and then simply use to or in (they are the same) when broadcasting or emitting. You can emit to several rooms at the same time
how do you leave a room?
To leave a channel you call leave in the same fashion as join, like, socket.leave(...) or simply disconnect.

Namespaces
What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?
A communication channel that allows you to split the logic of your application over a single shared connection (also called "multiplexing").
Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)
event handlers, rooms, and middlewares
Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces
When you want to create a special namespace that only authorized users have access to, so the logic related to those users is separated from the rest of the application and your application has multiple tenants so you want to dynamically create one namespace per tenant.
