MY OPINION:

- The concept of the Citizen Score implemented in China invades privacy. The Citizen Score being one-dimensional and based on an individual's clicks on the Internet, their politically-correct conduct or not, and it determines their credit terms, their access to certain jobs, and travel visas is absurd and will produce conflict. The Citizen Score is also based on the behavior of friends and acquaintances which is alarming. Having a society based on behavior and social control is a start to a huge disaster and chaos, especially in the US because humans are unpredictable even with data. Humans evolve if they want to or have the tools to. I am not the same person from a teen, early adulthood, or even yesterday because to the tools and resources I’ve gained and searched for over the years. My friends are their own beings going through life and that doesn’t affect my identity. My social media is heavy on tech, music, and funny memes. Social media doesn’t define my personality nor who I am. If America had a Citizen Score it would lead to more algorithmic biases aka racist robot acts, especially since it’s based on a one-dimensional race. America has many races and which one will it be based on for the "best citizen score"? Not minorities. Minorities already have a tough life and being judge from past mistakes, not being educationally informed, not given the resources tool to become informed should not impact of predict quality of life. Without the Citizen Score, It is already predicted that the average black family net worth will be zero. Having the Citizen score will further target minorities. Another version of slavery.
