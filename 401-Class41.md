# React Native

## [getting started with react native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

1. Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.

   - <Text> Displays, styles, and nests strings of text and even handles touch events
   - <ScrollView> A generic scrolling container that can contain multiple components and views

2. What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?

   - Solves business complexities of time and cost management with cross-platform apps with loads of features.
   - Call it native because it prevents conflicts among Native files

3. What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?

   - React Native Components, community components. core componenets, your native components.

   - React Native uses the same API structure as React components.

## [expo](https://expo.io/)

1. What solution does expo provide?

   - An open-source framework for apps that run natively on Android, iOS, and the web. Expo brings together the best of mobile and the web and enables many important features for building and scaling an app like live updates, instantly sharing your app, and web support.

2. Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the \_\_\_\_ workflow.

   - Managed

3. What is the difference between React Native and Expo?

   - React Native is the framework that allows developers to write Native code for mobile applications using JavaScript. Expo is a set of tools that facilitates development in React Native.

   - Expo is not a different framework but a set of guidelines and APIs that helps developers write code that is easy to maintain.

## [ejecting](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/expokit/eject)

1. What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?

   - Still depend on the Expo SDK, but your project no longer lives inside Expo Go. You control the native projects, including configuring and building them yourself.

2. When should you not eject?

   - All you need is to distribute your app in the iTunes Store or Google Play. Expo can build binaries for you in that case. If you eject, we can't automatically build for you any more.
   - You rely on asking for help in the Expo community. In your native Xcode and Android Studio projects, you may encounter questions which are no longer within the realm of Expo.

3. Why might you choose to eject?

   - Your Expo project needs a native module that Expo doesn't currently support.
